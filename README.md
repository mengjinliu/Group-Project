IEOR4501 Group Project by group27
## A file manifest
This repo include 3 files: README.md, Top10.ipynb, Parking.ipynb. This README file will illustrate what has been implemented. 

  The purpose of this group project was to explore the top 10 reasons for calling 311 in a zip code of NY10025. And, we will compare the incidence of illegal parking, one of the top ten reasons, in zip code 10025 with that of all of New York City.

  For the Top 10 reasons for calling 311. Firstly, I filter out the zipcode equal to 10025 then groupby 'Compliant Type'. Then sorted the value by 'Number' column in descending order and save the first 10 rows.
  
  To see the analysis of top 10 incident types, please check a Jupyter notebook called Top10.ipynb. To see the analysis of parking incidents, please check a Jupyter notebook called Parking.ipynb.
